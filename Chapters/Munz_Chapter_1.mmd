## Thesis Problem Statement

## Thesis Overview
Chapter 2 discusses Prewitt, Roberts, Fuzzy Logic, Sobel, and Canny edge detectio methods and their similarities and differences. The chapter also discusses the reasons why Canny is the "standard" in computer vision for edge detection and will review the assumptions made by John Canny for the Canny algorithm.

Chapter 3 intorduces the concept of optical flow in image processing and how optical flow can be combined with Canny edge detection to increase the amount of information obtained from a finite number of frames compared to that of information obtain by Canny edge detection alone. Reviewing the assumption made by Canny, the chapter will discuss a "Tuned" Canny algorithm specific to detecting road signs. Finally, the chapter presents the tests that will be performed to determined if more information can be gatheres.

Chapter 4 presents the results from using the LISA database where the images were taken as the vehicle traveled along the road. The results of the proof of concept will also be presented where the concept examines optical flow in multiple directions other than along the road.

Chapter 5 summarizes the findings from the tests and discusses the conclusions that can be made from the data. Future work is presented after the conclusion.
