## Litterature Review

The high level process flow for road sign detection and recognition is...
**(TODO)**: Finish intro paragraph for litt review.

* How everything fits together

* What everyone else has done?

### An Overview of the Detection and Recognition Process

* Take image
* Preprocess it
* Use color thresholding
* Use object localization
* Verify that it is a road sign
* Reduce image to sign area
* Match sign to database

### Capturing the Image

There are many different ways to capture an image...


#### Multiple Cameras [Miura]

One multiple camera method was by Miura et al. in the paper An Active Vision System for Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition. In this paper the authors describe a system that uses two cameras with different focal lenses to perform different segmentation tasks. [Miura]
**(TODO)**: Add more about the system in the Miura paper.


### Preprocessing

Some Authors performed process on an image after it was captured but before the segmentation and detection algorithms were performed on the image.

### Segmentation and Detection

Color and shape segmentation can be accomplished by using many different methods...

#### Neural Networks [Fang]

The author Chiung-Yao Fang uses multiple neural networks to perform color and shape segmentation.


### Verification

Many Authors used various verification methods to determine if the region of interest that the segmentation and or detection pass along is truley a road sign or not.


### Recognition

The final step is to classify the region of interests or to recognize it as a specfic sign.
