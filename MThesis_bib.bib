abstract = {This paper describes a computer vision based system for real-time robust traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition. Such a framework is of major interest for driver assistance in an intelligent automotive cockpit environment. The proposed approach consists of two components. First, signs are detected using a set of Haar wavelet features obtained from AdaBoost training. Compared to previously published approaches, our solution offers a generic, joint modeling of color and shape information without the need of tuning free parameters. Once detected, objects are efficiently tracked within a temporal information propagation framework. Second, classification is performed using Bayesian generative modeling. Making use of the tracking information, hypotheses are fused over multiple frames. Experiments show high detection and recognition accuracy and a frame rate of approximately 10 frames per second on a standard PC.},

abstract = {A detection of primordial non-Gaussianity could transform our understanding of the fundamental theory of inflation. The precision promised by upcoming CMB and large-scale structure surveys raises a natural question: if a detection given a particular template is made, what does this truly tell us about the underlying theory? In this paper we present a systematic way to constrain a wide range of non-Gaussian shapes, including general single and multi-field models and models with excited initial states. We present a separable, divergent basis able to recreate many shapes in the literature to high accuracy with between three and seven basis functions. The basis allows shapes to be grouped into broad "template classes", satisfying theoretically-relevant priors on their divergence properties in the squeezed limit. We forecast how well a Planck-like CMB survey could not only detect a general non-Gaussian signal but discern more about its shape, using existing templates and new ones we propose. This approach offers an opportunity to tie together minimal theoretical priors with observational constraints on the shape in general, and in the squeezed limit, to gain a deeper insight into what drove inflation.},

This study describes an approach to detecting and tracking road signs appearing in complex traffic scenes. In the detection phase, two neural networks are developed to extract color and shape features of traffic signs from the input scenes images. Traffic signs are then located in the images based on the extracted features. This process is primarily conceptualized in terms of fuzzy-set discipline. In the tracking phase, traffic signs located in the previous phase are tracked through image sequences using a Kalman filter. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in both detecting and tracking road signs present in complex scenes and in various weather and illumination conditions.},

abstract = {—In recent years optical-flow-aided position measurement solutions have been used in both commercial and academic applications. These systems are used for navigating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-deprived environments. Movement in sequential images is detected and converted to real world position change. Multiple approaches have been suggested, ranging from using an optical mouse sensor to the use of a stereo camera setup. Our research focuses on single camera solutions. Previous research has used a variety of optical flow algorithms for single camera solutions. This paper presents a comparison on three algorithms to check if using different algorithms yield different results in terms of quality and CPU time. This paper also provides insight into the general theory behind using single camera optical flow for UAV navigation. The compared algorithms are the Lucas-Kanade method, Gunnar Farne ack's algorithm and Block Matching. A testing framework and custom indoor and outdoor datasets were created to measure algorithms flow estimation quality and computation time. Characteristic differences were found between the performance of the algorithms in terms of both computation time and quality. Choosing between algorithms therefore can increase flow estimation quality or reduce CPU time usage. Also different winners per test set were found in terms of estimation quality.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the extraction of part of the visual information presented in streets, roads, and motorways. This information, provided by either traffic or road signs and route-guidance signs, is extremely important for safe and successful driving. An automatic system that is capable of extracting and identifying these signs automatically would help human drivers enormously; navigation would be easier and would allow him or her to concentrate on driving the vehicle. The system would indicate to the driver the presence of a sign in advance, so that some incorrect human decisions could be avoided. A deformable model scheme allows us to include the knowledge used while designing the signs in the algorithm and is used for their detection and identification. Two techniques to find the minimum in the energy function are shown: simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Some problems are addressed, such as uncontrolled lighting conditions; occlusions; and variations in shape, size, and color.},

We describe a two-dimensional (2D) visual object by the set of (labeled) distance sets associated with the feature points of that object. Based on a dissimilarity measure between (labeled) distance sets and a dissimilarity measure between sets of (labeled) distance sets, we address two problems that are often encountered in object recognition: object segmentation, for which we formulate a distance sets shape filter, and shape matching. The use of the shape filter is illustrated on printed and handwritten character recognition and detection of traffic signs in complex scenes. The shape comparison procedure is illustrated on handwritten character classification, COIL-20 database object recognition and MPEG-7 silhouette database retrieval.},

The Canny edge detector classifies a pixel as an edge if the gradient magnitude of the pixel is larger than those of pixels at both its sides in the direction of maximum intensity change. In this paper an efficient approach for improving canny edge detection Algorithm has been proposed which uses variable sigma and thresholding for different parts of the medical image.

abstract = {This study reports on the development of a system that incorporates color image processing and neural networks to detect and locate highway warning signs in natural roadway images. Such a system could reduce the need for redundant or oversized signs by assisting drivers in acquiring roadway information. Transportation agencies could use such a system as the first step in an automated highway sign inventory system. Currently, a human operator must watch hours of highway videos to complete this inventory. While only warning signs were considered in this study, the procedure was designed to be easily adapted to all highway signs. The basic approach is to digitize a roadway image and segment this image, using a back-propagation neural network, into eight colors that are important to highway sign detection. Next, the system scans the image for color regions that may possibly represent highway warning signs. Upon finding possible warning sign regions, these regions are further analyzed by a second back-propagation neural network to determine if their shape corresponds to that of a highway warning sign},

Bidirectional motion is estimated based on spatial coherence and similarity of seg-ment colors. Our model is extended to video by chaining the pairwise models to produce a joint probability distribution to be maximized. To make the problem more tractable, we factorize the posterior distribution and iteratively minimize its parts. We demonstrate our method on frame interpola-tion.},

abstract = {This paper presents an active vision system for real-time traffic sign recognition. The system is composed of two cameras, one is equipped with a wide-angle lens and the other with a telephoto-lens, and a PC with an image processing board. The system first detects candidates for traffic signs in the wide-angle image using color; intensity, and shape information. For each candidate, the telephoto-camera is directed to its predicted position to capture the candidate in a larger size in the image. The recognition algorithm is designed by intensively using built-in-functions of an off-the-shelf image processing board to realize both easy implementation and fast recognition. The results of on-road real-time experiments show the feasibility of the system},

abstract = {Edge Detection from colored images or gray scaled images belongs to the field of Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision. An edge defines the boundaries between or among regions or objects in an image therefore edge detection helps to identify objects from the given images and also assists in image segmentation. Many techniques are being used for detecting edge(s) from a given image for various kinds of applications like boundary detection, object recognition and many more. Prewitt, Sobel and Canny are the most popular and more frequently used techniques for the same. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations. This review paper consists of discussion of such techniques with their implementations and comparisons using certain parameters like lightning conditions, image acquisition methods, image quality, and presence of noise.},

The processing of video frames in the L*a*b color space improves significantly the sign detection rate by processing the same frame in different normalized color spaces. The tracking module reduces significantly the processing time by transferring the sign detection information in the next frames and processing different radii signs in parallel. The proposed system is evaluated in normal, raining and night driving conditions. In a total number of 266 road-sign recordings, the complete system track and recognize successfully 216. The main source of system fault appears in city night driving due to the presence of a great number of light sources},

@article{Smeets2012,
abstract = {Intra-shape deformations complicate 3D shape recognition and therefore need proper modeling. Thereto, an isometric deformation model is used in this paper. The method proposed does not need explicit point correspondences for the comparison of 3D shapes. The geodesic distance matrix is used as an isometry-invariant shape representation. Two approaches are described to arrive at a sampling order invariant shape descriptor: the histogram of geodesic distance matrix values and the set of largest singular values of the geodesic distance matrix. Shape comparison is performed by comparison of the shape descriptors using the $\chi$2-distance as dissimilarity measure. For object recognition, the results obtained demonstrate the singular value approach to outperform the histogram-based approach, as well as the state-of-the-art multidimensional scaling technique, the ICP baseline algorithm and other isometric deformation modeling methods found in literature. Using the TOSCA database, a rank-1 recognition rate of 100{\%} is obtained for the identification scenario, while the verification experiments are characterized by a 1.58{\%} equal error rate. External validation demonstrates that the singular value approach outperforms all other participants for the non-rigid object retrieval contests in SHREC 2010 as well as SHREC 2011. For 3D face recognition, the rank-1 recognition rate is 61.9{\%} and the equal error rate is 11.8{\%} on the BU-3DFE database. This decreased performance is attributed to the fact that the isometric deformation assumption only holds to a limited extent for facial expressions. This is also demonstrated in this paper.},
